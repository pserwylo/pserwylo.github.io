Below you will find my presentation at ISCRAM 2011, entitled "Predicting Patient Presentation Rates at Mass Gatherings using Machine Learning".
It was for an article co-authored by [Paul Arbon](https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/paul.arbon), [Grace Rumantir](https://web.archive.org/web/20110412051502/http://www.infotech.monash.edu/about/staff/Grace-Rumantir) and I.
It was accepted in the ["Planning and Foresight"](https://web.archive.org/web/20120518222708/http://iscram2011.lnec.pt/) track chaired by [Murray Turoff](https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/).
I like to think that the talk went pretty smoothly, and am looking forward to when they publish the videos.

<h1>A More Complex Use Case</h1>

<p>
Without going into too much detail, we will have a look at a more complex use
case for AOP. A good example is that provided by Java 2 Enterprise Edition. 
In order to deploy one 'Bean' (essentially a class which performs business logic) 
which is accessible by a J2EE server and clients, you require at least four files:
<ul>
<li>
	The bean class itself:<br />
	<code>public function RecordEJB implements SessionBean { ... }</code><br /><br />
</li>
<li>
	A 'remote' interface:<br />
	<code>public interface Record extends EJBObject { ... }</code><br /><br />
</li>
<li>
	A 'home' interface:<br />
	<code>public interface RecordHome extends EJBHome { ... }</code><br /><br />
</li>
<li>XML defining the bean name, type and other information</li>
</ul>

The contents of each of these files depend on what functions exist in the original Bean. As you
can imagine, there is a lot of work to be done when a new function is added to
the bean. In this case, a tool called <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/">xdoclet</a> employs AOP to automatically 
generate a heap of scaffolding code for you at complile time. It does this by
preprocessing the class and method comments looking for attributes of interest. 
</p>

<pre>
/**
 * @ejb-bean name="Record"
 */
public function RecordEJB implements SessionBean { ... }
</pre>

<p>
Now instead of writing all of the afore mentioned files manually an automated
build process can parse the @ejb-bean attribute, and automatically generate
all of the required scaffolding. The tool used to do this supports multiple 
attributes, each contributin to different parts of the code generation. For 
example, just at the class level, the following attribute tags are available:
</p>

<code>@ejb.bean, @ejb.dao, @ejb.data-object, @ejb.ejb-external-ref, @ejb.ejb-ref, 
@ejb.env-entry, @ejb.facade, @ejb.finder, @ejb.home, @ejb.interface, 
@ejb.persistence, @ejb.pk, @ejb.remote-facade, @ejb.resource-env-ref, 
@ejb.resource-ref, @ejb.security-identity, @ejb.security-role-ref, 
@ejb.security-roles, @ejb.util, @ejb.value-object
</code>

<p>
Each of these attributes mean something different to xdoclet, despite them just
being plain text to the Java VM. You can see from the extent of the xdoclet 
tool that there is a multitude of uses that can be achieved. Incidentaly, the
syntax used to annotate Java code with xdoclet attributes does not use the native
Java Annotation sytax, presumably because that was a relatively new addition to
the syntax, whereas xdoclet has been around for a while.
</p>

<p>
The only point about this example though, is that AOP is used as a preprocessing 
step during the build process. Because PHP is an interpreted language, this 
facility does not exist. The following example will show how we use AOP 
at runtime in a PHP application at IVT.

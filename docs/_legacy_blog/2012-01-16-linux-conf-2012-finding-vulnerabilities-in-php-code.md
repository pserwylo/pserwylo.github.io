This is a very old talk. The tools here are very outdated, and there are [many more, much better alternatives](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=php+static+analysis) to static analysis of PHP code these days.
Nevertheless, it was a great opportunity to research and discuss such topics back in 2012, and I am grateful that I had these opportunities to practice my public speaking.

This is a talk given at the [Open Programming Miniconf](https://web.archive.org/web/20130410053915/http://lca2012.linux.org.au/wiki/index.php/Miniconfs/OpenProgramming) at [linux.conf.au 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409163824/http://lca2012.linux.org.au/) in Ballarat, Vic. It is about analysing code without actually executing it, in order to identify possible code injection vulnerabilities. The miniconf was organised by [Christopher Neugebauer](https://twitter.com/chrisjrn).

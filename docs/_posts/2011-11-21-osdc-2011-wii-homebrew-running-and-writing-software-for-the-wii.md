I [spoke](https://web.archive.org/web/20120115125428/http://2011.osdc.com.au/schedule/#wiihomebrewrunnin) at the [OSDC 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114223236/http://2011.osdc.com.au/) in Canberra, Australia.
The talk was about writing and using [homebrew](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Glossary#H) software on the Wii. I got some great feedback after the talk, and was happy to see so many people interested in the idea.
I was also pleased to see how many people already have a modded Wii.
Hopefully I was able to give a few people some tips.

## Presentation Software

Part of my preparation for the talk was to hack together some presentation software to run on the Wii.
This allowed me to give the actual presentation on the Wii.
I called it Priijector (because every piece of software for the Wii has to have a double ii somewhere, and everything homebrew related has to include a pun).
It will read a `pres.txt` file in a custom (and hacky) markup to define slides and transitions.

You can [get the code from GitHub](https://github.com/pserwylo/Priijector) (GPLv3 license).

## Slides used in Presentation

Please [click the image below](/archive/talks/osdc/2011/pres.pdf) to download the PDF of the presentation (3mb). The quality is a little poor, because I had to take screenshots of each slide from within the Dolphin emulator at a resolution of 640Ã—480.

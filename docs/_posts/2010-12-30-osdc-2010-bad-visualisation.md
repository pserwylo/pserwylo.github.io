I was lucky enough to be accepted to talk at OSDC 2010, which was a well organised conference of like minded Open Source developers and enthusiasts in Melbourne.
My talk was not directly related to any open source technology, but rather some general guidelines about what _not_ to do when visualising data.
It is a commentry on the works of people like [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and [Stephen Few](http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/).
The talk was well received, and I was very pleased with how it went.

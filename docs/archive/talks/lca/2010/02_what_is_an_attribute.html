<h1>What is an Attribute?</h1>

<p>
You will all be familiar with attributes, no matter what language you use,
or how you choose to use it. An attribute is a tag inside a comment block,
which has a special meaning somewhere, somehow. In the majority of cases, the
tags are processed during documentation generation:
</p>

<pre>
/**
 * Creates a new record and returns its serial.
 * @param string $name The title of the record to create.
 * @return int The serial number of the newly created record.
 */
public function createRecord( $name ) { ... }
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, the tags <code>@param</code> and <code>@return</code> are 
attributes. When generating documentation for the function, those two lines have
special significance, because they will end up in a particular location in the
documentation template, with a particular type of formating, and perhaps a 
link to another part of the documentation.

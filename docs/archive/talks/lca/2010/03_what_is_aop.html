<h1>What is Attribute Oriented Programming?</h1>

<p>
So then, Attribute Oriented Programming (which I will refer to as AOP, despite the 
obvious clash with Aspect Oriented Programming) is utilising attributes in your
code, to achieve extra functionality. Some languages natively support attributes, such as 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">Java (Annotations)</a> or 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fkytk30f.aspx">.NET (Attributes)</a>.
PHP does not natively support such a feature, so this talk will discuss techniques 
to achieve the same sort of results. The following pages will show first:
<ul>
	<li><a href="04_simple_use_case.html">A simple use case to illustrate the idea</a></li>
	<li><a href="05_complex_use_case.html">A real world use case from Java</a></li>
	<li><a href="06_ivt_example.html">An example currently being used by my workplace</a></li>
</ul>

If this is of interest to you, it is worth noting this is *not* the topic of my final PhD. That pivoted quite substantially between this presentation and the final thesis in 2016.

At [ISCRAM 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20120219152309/iscram2011.lnec.pt/), Tung Bui organised the PhD Colloquium which I (in addition to several other students) attended.
The talk outlining the focus of my PhD (at the time of the conference) is available below.

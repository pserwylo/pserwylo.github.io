<h1>Real World Example</h1>

<p>
At Internet Vision Techonologies, we develop a service oriented web application.
Given it is already split nicely into services, we decided to expose certain functionality
externally as web services. In order to do this, we use a simplistic implementation of AOP
in PHP, using the PHP reflection API, to permission certain functions. Each function 
which is to be exposed as a web service requires an attribute called <code>@access</code>.
If this is not present, the function is not exposed as a web service. If it is defined 
then the currently logged in user must hold all of the access credentials specified.
</p>

<pre>
require_once( "AttributeFinder.php" );

class RecordService
{
    
    /**
     * This function will pretend to create a record, but will restrict access
     * to users with a position of 'admin' and 'user'.
     * @access admin Requires admin users to create a new record
     * @access user Also must be of type user
     */
    public function createRecord( $name )
    {
        echo "Creating record...\n";
    }

}

$attributeFinder = new AttributeFinder( "RecordService", "createRecord" );
$requiredAccess = $attributeFinder->getAccess();

echo "Only go ahead with the invocation of createRecord() if the current user is in all of these groups:\n";
echo implode( ", ", $requiredAccess ) . "\n";
</pre>

<p>
The above code shows an example usage of this technique. The class AttributeFinder is
just a very simple class which utilises PHP's reflection API to extract the doc 
comments and then perform a little bit of string processing to extract the attributes.
</p>

<pre>
/**
 * Given a class or a method, looks for particular attributes inside the doc-comments for that class/method.
 * Also has a few helper functions for tasks which this was introduced for (i.e. method authentication).
 * @author Peter Serwylo (peter@ivt.com.au)

	private $className;

	 * (like in standard PHP: param, in your application: access).

	 * @return array List of attribute values matching $attribute.

	{

		{
			return $matches[1];
		}
		
		return array();
	
	}

	/**

	 * Each tag can have a comment as well, but only the first "word" is examined and expected to be an int.

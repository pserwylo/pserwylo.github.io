This year I again attended the [Open Source Developers Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20130513112704/http://2012.osdc.com.au/talks/building-freeish-mame-cabinet). The talk I gave was another light hearted one, this time about building a MAME Cabinet using reclaimed rubbish. A huge props to the organising team for an awesome conference.

		<h1>Please, no more gauges: How NOT to visualize data</h1>
		<p>
			Here is a link to the <a href="pres/final.svg">presentation</a>. It's an SVG file best viewed in Firefox. Chrome seems to compress the images and not play the video on one of the first slides.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had a couple of people come up to me after the presentation and ask about the software I used to create the presentation. 
			After I saw a presentation at uni from a bloke using <a href="http://www.prezi.com">Prezi</a>, I went looking for an open source alternative.
			The closest I could get was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jessyink/">Jessy ink</a>, a plugin for Inkscape which outputs a single SVG file with a bit of embedded JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I'm not sure about how Prezi goes about its editing, but I'm really impressed with Jessy Ink.
			It works on the basis of each layer being a slide. You can assign transitions to each slide, and also to individual components on the slide (ala a typical presentation application).
			The bit that I wanted was the "Views" where each slide can have sub-views. It provides a way to conceptualise each slide as a giant poster, where you can navigate around that poster to highlight certain aspects of your "poster".
